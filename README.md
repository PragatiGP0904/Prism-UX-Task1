## Project Overview

This repository contains my final submission for PrismStudio's internship assignment. The task(1) was to create two user personas using real data collected through a Google Form, and design empathy maps to understand user needs, behaviors, and frustrations.

I explored a fun-yet-professional tone to match the relatable nature of my users (college students), while still keeping the structure aligned with UX case study standards.

## Survey Link

I used this Google Form to collect real responses for building my personas and empathy maps:
